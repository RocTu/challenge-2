Containerize the orchestrator project using a Dockerfile. Optionally include a docker-compose.yml for easier orchestration.
Then, set up a GitHub Actions workflow that builds a Docker image on every push to the main branch and tags the image with the commit SHA.  

Create a new public GitHub repository, commit your updates there, and share the repository link in the textarea.
